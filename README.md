## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my personal journey on trying to become a junior level Data Analysis. I plan to upload all of my notes and learning journey here to share with other and to reference. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on starting a new jounrey in the Data Science / Business Analytics field
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at the Uuniversity Colorado Denver obtain my graduare degree in MS of Business Aanalytics and Information Systems
- ðŸ‘¯ At the moment a I am unsure what I would like to collaborate on, however I would certainly enjoy working with others who are also starting a new journey in this field. Lets learn and grow together. 
- âš¡ Fun facts: 
  - I am a person who is a true hobbyist and enjoyt trying new things
  - Used to be a personal trainer, so if you have questions on how to maintain a well balnced healthy life while being a keyboard warrrior, please reach out. 
  - I don't consider myself a nerd, just one who enjoys learning new things. It can be in tech, art, life hacks, etc.
